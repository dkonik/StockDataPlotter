# StockDataPlotter

Gets stock data from Google Finance. Can get minute granularity for the past 5 days, and daily data history for a long time.

Also can plot any function that you do on the data you just have to modify the plot function to do whatever you want. 

Currently it will plot the data, 1st, and 2nd derivative.
